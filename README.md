# Practising Greedy Algorithms

Practising  Greedy(G) Algorithms. 

Generally, G-Algorithms are "easy" (practical) solutions to "complex" (NP-Hard) problems.
G-Algorithms guarantee to find a solution. However, it is not guaranteed to find the optimal one
and, what it is even worse, the gap between the solution provided and the optimal one is not bounded.

In practice, however, G-Algorithms are of high interest and perform pretty well under "typical" (e.g. average) circumstances.
In scientific literature, it is generally required to provide relevant performance guarantees (e.g., the gap is bounded by some well defined factor)
when a G-Algorithm is presented.
