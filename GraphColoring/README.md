Potential issues of the greedy algorithm

<img src="/GraphColoring/problem_greedy_potential_issues.JPG" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

Note that this will depend on the numbering of nodes or the way we traverse those.
The greedy algorithm can perfectly use 2 colors for this bipartite graph
by traversing first "column" and then the second one.

__Difficulty in literature__

This problem is considered Medium in literature.
